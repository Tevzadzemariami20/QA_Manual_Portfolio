# Add Logout Confirmation Pop-up

## Why this is a problem:
Currently, clicking the **Logout** icon logs the user out immediately without any confirmation. This may cause users to log out accidentally.

## What should be done:
Implement a **confirmation pop-up** when the user clicks the Logout icon.  

#### The pop-up should ask the user to confirm the action and include:
- **Yes / Confirm** button – proceeds with logout
- **Cancel** button – closes the pop-up and keeps the user logged in
