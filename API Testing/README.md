# API Testing
## Overview
This section demonstrates my hands-on experience in manual API testing using the ReqRes public REST API.
The goal of this project is to validate API endpoints by verifying request handling, response status codes, response body structure, and error scenarios.
Testing was performed using Postman, focusing on CRUD operations and REST API best practices.

## Scope of Testing
- GET – Retrieve user and resource details
- POST – Create new resources
- PUT – Update existing resources
- DELETE – Remove users

## Documented Test Scenarios
### GET Requests
- Retrieve a specific user by ID
- Validate response structure and data fields
- Verify behavior with and without authorization
### POST Requests
- Create a new resource with valid data
- Validate response status and generated fields
- Handle missing or invalid request body scenarios
### PUT Requests
- Update existing resource details
- Validate updated fields and timestamps
### DELETE Requests
- Delete an existing user
- Validate 204 No Content response

## Key Takeaways
- Understanding of REST API fundamentals
- Hands-on experience with CRUD operations
- Ability to document test cases clearly and professionally
- Experience validating both positive and negative scenarios
